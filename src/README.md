\# Token Required with Python

This Python script demonstrates how to implement token-based authentication to secure access to your application or API. By requiring a valid token, you can control who can access your resources.

\#\# Getting Started

\#\#\# Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed.
- Basic understanding of Python and API handling.

\#\#\# Installation

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   \```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use .\env\Scripts\activate
   \```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   \```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   \```

3. Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`:

   \```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   \```

4. Open the `.env` file and replace `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual token.

\#\# Usage

In your Python script, use the following code to require a token:

\

# Example Usage
Use it in Postman
\```

\#\# Security Considerations

- Always keep the token secure. Do not expose it in public repositories or hardcode it in your code.
- Use environment variables to store sensitive information.
- Rotate your tokens periodically for added security.
